# About

![Nathan Palmer](https://res.cloudinary.com/ishimby/image/upload/v1592239051/2016_-_Profile_Pic_-_Medium_-_2000x1333_vwa0yk.jpg)

I am an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Georgia Southern University. My research explores how people understand social phenomena, explain social inequality, and develop from novices to expert sociologists. You can find most of my publications on this site.

As an educator I've received multiple awards for teaching and contributions to the discipline. I created SociologySource.org in 2010 to share ideas & resources for teaching sociology. In 2012, I created SociologyInFocus.com, a platform for sociologists to get paid to communicate core sociological ideas to students/the public using current events. Together both sites garnered well over a million views. Both of these projects were recognized by Merlot.org, profiled in important academic texts, and select essays were featured and/or republished on prominent online outlets like Mic.com, Vox, and New York Magazine. You can find information about the classes I teach & download resources for teaching sociology [here](https://ishimby.github.io/natepalmer/resources.html).
