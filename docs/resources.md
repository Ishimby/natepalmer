I love making things for social science educators. Below are some of my favorite creations and links to fantastic resources created by others. 

## Why People Do Things: The Essentials

_Why People Do Things: The Essentials_ is a primer on how sociologists view the world and how they formulate explanations of social phenomena. In a quick 2,000 words, _Why People Do Things_ defines social structure, culture, and individual agency and describes how society is created out of the relationships between all three. Using well-established social theory, _Why People Do Things_ explains how structure and culture influence individuals and how individual agency and social interaction create society.
