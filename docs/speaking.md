Every audience is an opportunity. When we come together to share honestly, listen intently, and engage each other in good faith deep learning and meaningful change becomes possible. 

Over the last ten years, I've developed a knack for navigating hard conversations, facilitative meaningful discussions, and finding ways to reach even the most skeptical audience members. I have led 100+ in-person and remote speaking engagements at major universities, events, and organizations like Penn State, the University of Nebraska, Pearson Publishing, and the American Sociological Association. I've given keynote addresses & commencement speeches, facilitated town-hall discussions, led workshops, hosted webinars, and served on countless panels. I speak on a wide variety of topics; from overcoming academic adversity to racism to leveraging technology to improve research & teaching.
